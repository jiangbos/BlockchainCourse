## Oracle

Data feed services that provide smart contracts with external information / off-chain information. [@Klages-Mundt2020]

1. Centralized oracle
    * can be proven that the data feed is an authentic representation of a particular source
    * but it is still inherently manipulable by the source
1. Decentralized oracle: remain an open research question

## Atomic swap

![Hash Timelock Contracts](figure/htlc-f-upd.png){width=80%}

---

1. Alice initiates the transaction by generating a secret (a key) that will be used to unlock the asset transfers later on. She then deploys a smart contract on Chain$_a$, that will lock her assets until time $t_a$.     * This contract will transfer to Bob the assets only if the secret generated by Alice is revealed and entered in the smart contract.
    * After time $t_a$, should the secret have not been revealed, the smart contract expires and Alice's assets will be unlocked and returned to her wallet
1. Bob can verify the contract deployed by Alice on Chain$_a$ (assets, delivery address, etc.) and use the hash submitted by Alice in order to deploy a similar contract on Chain$_b$.
1. Alice can verify the contract deployed on Chain$_b$, unlock the assets, and initiate their transfer to her wallet by revealing the secret on Chain$_b$.
1. As early as when the secret is revealed in the mempool of Chain$_b$ (even before the Alice's transfer is confirmed), Bob can use the secret to unlock the assets on Chain$_a$ and complete the cross-ledger transaction.

# Coding smart contracts [@Perez2019a]

## Flow of a Bitcoin redeem script

1. Write script
2. Hash script to create address
3. Receive Bitcoins
4. Publish script and required data (usually signature) using a transaction


## From Bitcoin Scripting to Smart Contracts

We need more features to write general programs

* Persistent state  
  &rarr; account-based  
  &rarr; storage primitives
* Turing-completeness (loops)  
  &rarr; jump primitive
* More transparency?  
  &rarr; code deployed before usage


## Smart Contract implementing a simple coin {.shrink}

```javascript
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

## What can/can't Smart Contracts do?

### Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

### Can't

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically


## Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address


## How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcasted in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A


## A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result


## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Bytecode ...

### Simple loop from 0 to 10 using EVM instructions

```javascript
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

## ... will look something like {.shrink}

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```


## Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

## Gas computation {.shrink}

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

## Gas computation: special cases {.shrink}

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

## Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned

# Ethereum Smart Contract Programming


## Solidity

* High-level language targeting the EVM
* Looks vaguely like JavaScript
* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system
* Contains smart contract related primitives
* Supports multiple inheritance


## Compiling Smart Contracts: functions

* EVM bytecode has no concept of functions, only conditional jumps
* Solidity creates a conditional jump for each function
* Solidity uses function signatures to choose which function to call
* Transaction sent to the contract must contain the necessary data to trigger the function

## Sample signature {.shrink}

```javascript
claimFunds(address receiver)
```

### Conditional jumps
```x86asm
CALLDATASIZE      ; load data size
ISZERO
PUSH2 0x00c4      ; default function location
JUMPI
CALLDATALOAD      ; load data
DUP1
PUSH4 0x24600fc3  ; function signature hash
EQ
PUSH2 0x00db      ; function location
JUMPI
DUP1
PUSH4 0x30b67baa
EQ
PUSH2 0x00e6
JUMPI
```


## Compiling Smart Contracts: types

* EVM only has 256 bit words
* Solidity has a simple type system including
  * integer types
  * data structures (lists, maps)
* Integer types are encoded using bitwise operations  
  e.g. `uint8`: `uint256 & 0xff`
* Data structures are encoded using hash  
  e.g. `key(list[5]) = keccak256(index(list) . 5)`


<!-- # Smart Contract Security -->

<!-- ## Smart Contracts: What could go wrong? -->

<!-- ### TheDAO hack (2016) -->

<!-- * TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO* -->
<!-- * Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M* -->
<!-- * Price of Ether halved -->
<!-- * Ethereum community decided to hard-fork -->
<!-- * Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability -->

<!-- ### Parity Wallet bug (2017) -->


<!-- * Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts -->
<!-- * Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug" -->
<!-- * *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds -->
<!-- * Around *$280M frozen* -->


<!-- ## Common vulnerabilities / bugs -->

<!-- * Re-entrancy -->
<!--   * Can allow an attacker to drain funds -->
<!-- * Unhandled exceptions -->
<!--   * Can result in lost funds -->
<!-- * Dependency on destructed contract -->
<!--   * Can result in locked funds -->
<!-- * Transaction order dependency -->
<!--   * Can allow an attacker to manipulate prices -->
<!-- * Integer overflow -->
<!--   * Can result in locked fund -->


<!-- ## Re-entrancy {.shrink} -->

<!-- * Vulnerable contract sends money before updating state -->

<!-- * Attacker contract’s fallback function is called -->

<!-- * Attacker contract makes re-entrant call to attacker -->


<!-- ### Vulnerable contract -->

<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- function payMe(address account) public { -->
<!--   uint amount = getAmount(account); -->
<!--   // XXX: vulnerable -->
<!--   if (!account.send(amount)) -->
<!--     throw; -->
<!--   balance[account] -= amount; -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Attacker contract -->

<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- function () { -->
<!--   victim.payMe(owner); -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Unhandled exception {.shrink} -->


<!-- * In Solidity, not all failed "calls" raise an exception -->

<!-- * If the failed call returns a boolean, it must be checked correctly -->

<!-- * Failure to do this could result in inconsistent state or even locked funds -->

<!-- ### Problematic contract -->


<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- // allows user to withdraw funds -->
<!-- function withdraw(address account) public { -->
<!--   uint amount = getAmount(account); -->
<!--   balance[account] -= amount; -->
<!--   account.send(amount); // could silently fail -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Dependency on destructed contract {.shrink} -->

<!-- * Contracts can use other contracts as library -->

<!-- * If the library contract gets destructed, the call becomes a no-op -->

<!-- * If the only way for a contract to send money is to use the library, -->
<!-- Ether can be locked -->

<!-- ### Library contract -->
<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- function sendEther(address recipient, -->
<!--                    uint value) public onlyOwner { -->
<!--   address.send(value) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Contract using library -->
<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- address public library = 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470; -->
<!-- function sendEther(address recipient, uint value) public { -->
<!--   bytes4 sig =  bytes4(sha3("sendEther(address, uint)")); -->
<!--   library.delegatecall(sig, recipient, value); -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Transaction Order Dependency -->

<!-- * Result can change depending on the order of the transactions -->

<!-- * Miners are free to choose the miner order of the transactions in a block -->

<!-- * There can be financial incentives to perform such manipulations -->


<!-- ### Contract vulnerable to transaction order dependency -->

<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- function solve() { -->
<!--   if (msg.sender == owner) {// update reward -->
<!--     owner.send(reward); -->
<!--     reward = msg.value; -->
<!--   } else if (puzzleSolved(msg.data)) { -->
<!--     msg.sender.send(reward); //send reward -->
<!--     solution = msg.data; -->
<!--   } -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Integer Overflow {.shrink} -->

<!-- * Solidity has many different numeric types -->
<!--   * `int8` to `int256` and `uint8` to `uint256` -->
<!-- * Types are encoded in EVM using bit manipulations -->
<!--   * If `a` is `uint8`, a `AND a 0xff` would be generated -->
<!-- * Variables may therefore overflow or underflow during execution -->


<!-- ### Contract vulnerable to integer overflow -->


<!-- ```javascript -->
<!-- function overflow(uint fee) { -->
<!--   uint amount = 100; -->

<!--   // underflows if fee > 100 -->
<!--   amount -= fee; -->

<!--   // tries to send a large value -->
<!--   // and fails on underflow -->
<!--   msg.sender.send(amount); -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Smart Contract analysis tools -->

<!-- * Usually static analysis and/or symbolic execution -->

<!-- * Work either on Solidity or on the EVM bytecode -->

<!-- * Check for known vulnerabilities/patterns -->

# Programming hands-on

## Ecosystem Overview

* Solc: Solidity compiler
* Truffle: Framework to help build/test
* Ganache: Easy setup of local private chain 
* Mythril, Securify, etc: Static analysis tools


## Installing software

### NodeJS (if not already installed)

Follow instructions at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Truffle

```
npm install -g truffle
```

## What we will build

A simple token compliant with the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

This is how most "coins" or "tokens" are implemented on Ethereum.
It defines a common interface to

* Transfer tokens
* Allow other parties to transfer tokens
* Check balance for tokens
* Emit events for token transfers

## ERC-20 interface {.shrink}

```javascript
// Returns the total supply of tokens
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)

// Returns the balance of `_owner`
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)

// Transfers `_value` from sender to `_to`
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Transfers `_value` from `_from` to `_to` if `_from` authorized the send
function transferFrom(
address _from, address _to, uint256 _value
) public returns (
bool success
)

// Approves `_spender` to spend `_value` on behalf of the sender
function approve(
address _spender, uint256 _value
) public returns (
bool success
)

// Returns how much `_spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of `_owner`
function allowance(
address _owner, address _spender
) public view returns (
uint256 remaining
)

// Is emitted when `_from` transfers `_value` to `_to`
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
// Is emitted when `_owner` allows `_spender` to spend `_value` on his behalf
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

## Token specifics

We will build a very simple token:

* Fixed total supply (1,000,000 for the sake of example)
  * No tokens can be created or burned after creation
* All tokens belong to owner at contract creation time
* No other particular limitation

## Starting to develop {.shrink}

Start a new project

```
mkdir my-token
cd my-token
truffle init
truffle create contract MyToken
```

Create migration file: `migrations/2_my_token.js`

```javascript
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MyToken);
};
```

<!-- ## Implement and test the project  -->


Download the specs for the project

```bash
wget https://git.io/smart-contract-intro-spec -O test/my-token-test.js
```

Run the tests

```
truffle test
```

Get the contract skeleton (optional)  

If you are not confident, you can get the skeleton to get started

```bash
wget https://git.io/smart-contract-intro-skel -O contracts/MyToken.sol
```

Now, implement the contract and run the tests regularly.  
Check [the ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) for more details about each function.
