# Coding smart contracts [@Perez2019a]

## Smart Contract implementing a simple coin {.shrink}

```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  // "mapping" creates "balances" as state variable
  // "public" makes variables accessible from other contracts
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  // constructor (optional) is only run when the contract is created
  constructor() public {minter = msg.sender;}

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

## What can/can't Smart Contracts do?

### Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

### Can't

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically


## Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address


## How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcast in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A


## A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result


## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Bytecode ...

### Simple loop from 0 to 10 using EVM instructions

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

## ... will look something like {.shrink}

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```


## Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

## Gas computation {.shrink}

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

## Gas computation: special cases {.shrink}

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

## Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned

# Ethereum Smart Contract Programming


## Solidity

* High-level language targeting the EVM
* Looks vaguely like JavaScript
* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system
* Contains smart contract related primitives
* Supports multiple inheritance


## Compiling Smart Contracts: functions

* EVM bytecode has no concept of functions, only conditional jumps
* Solidity creates a conditional jump for each function
* Solidity uses function signatures to choose which function to call
* Transaction sent to the contract must contain the necessary data to trigger the function

## Sample signature {.shrink}

```solidity
claimFunds(address receiver)
```

### Conditional jumps
```x86asm
CALLDATASIZE      ; load data size
ISZERO
PUSH2 0x00c4      ; default function location
JUMPI
CALLDATALOAD      ; load data
DUP1
PUSH4 0x24600fc3  ; function signature hash
EQ
PUSH2 0x00db      ; function location
JUMPI
DUP1
PUSH4 0x30b67baa
EQ
PUSH2 0x00e6
JUMPI
```


## Compiling Smart Contracts: types

* EVM only has 256 bit words
* Solidity has a simple type system including
  * integer types
  * data structures (lists, maps)
* Integer types are encoded using bitwise operations  
  e.g. `uint8`: `uint256 & 0xff`
* Data structures are encoded using hash  
  e.g. `key(list[5]) = keccak256(index(list) . 5)`


# Smart Contract Security

## Smart Contracts: What could go wrong?

### TheDAO hack (2016)

* TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO*
* Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M*
* Price of Ether halved
* Ethereum community decided to hard-fork
* Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability

### Parity Wallet bug (2017)


* Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts
* Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug"
* *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds
* Around *$280M frozen*


## Common vulnerabilities / bugs

* Re-entrancy
  * Can allow an attacker to drain funds
* Unhandled exceptions
  * Can result in lost funds
* Dependency on destructed contract
  * Can result in locked funds
* Transaction order dependency
  * Can allow an attacker to manipulate prices
* Integer overflow
  * Can result in locked fund


## Re-entrancy {.shrink}

* Vulnerable contract sends money before updating state

* Attacker contractâ€™s fallback function is called

* Attacker contract makes re-entrant call to attacker


### Vulnerable contract

```solidity
function payMe(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  // XXX: vulnerable
  if (!account.send(amount))
    throw;
  balance[account] -= amount;
}
```

### Attacker contract

```solidity
function () {
  victim.payMe(owner);
}
```

## Unhandled exception {.shrink}


* In Solidity, not all failed "calls" raise an exception

* If the failed call returns a boolean, it must be checked correctly

* Failure to do this could result in inconsistent state or even locked funds

### Problematic contract


```solidity
// allows user to withdraw funds
function withdraw(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  balance[account] -= amount;
  account.send(amount); // could silently fail
}
```


## Dependency on destructed contract {.plain}

* Contracts can use other contracts as library
  * If the library contract gets destructed, the call becomes a no-op
      * If the only way for a contract to send money is to use the library, Ether can be locked

### Library contract
```solidity
function sendEther(address recipient,
                   uint value) public onlyOwner {
  address.send(value)
}
```

### Contract using library
```solidity
address public library = 0xdcc...470;
function sendEther(address recipient, 
                   uint value) public {
  bytes4 sig = bytes4(sha3("sendEther(address, uint)"));
  library.delegatecall(sig, recipient, value);
  }
```


## Transaction Order Dependency

* Result can change depending on the order of the transactions

* Miners are free to choose the miner order of the transactions in a block

* There can be financial incentives to perform such manipulations


### Contract vulnerable to transaction order dependency

```solidity
function solve() {
  if (msg.sender == owner) {// update reward
    owner.send(reward);
    reward = msg.value;
  } else if (puzzleSolved(msg.data)) {
    msg.sender.send(reward); //send reward
    solution = msg.data;
  }
}
```


## Integer Overflow {.shrink}

* Solidity has many different numeric types
  * `int8` to `int256` and `uint8` to `uint256`
* Types are encoded in EVM using bit manipulations
  * If `a` is `uint8`, a `AND a 0xff` would be generated
* Variables may therefore overflow or underflow during execution


### Contract vulnerable to integer overflow


```solidity
function overflow(uint fee) {
  uint amount = 100;

  // underflows if fee > 100
  amount -= fee;

  // tries to send a large value
  // and fails on underflow
  msg.sender.send(amount);
}
```

## Installing software

### NodeJS (if not already installed)


Download from: https://nodejs.org/en/

Or install with `homebrew`

```sh
brew install node
```

<!-- ### Use `nvm` for version control of `node` -->

<!-- `truffle` is compatible with `node` 12, but not `node` 14 -->

<!-- Follow instructions at: https://medium.com/@Joachim8675309/installing-node-js-with-nvm-4dc469c977d9 -->

### Truffle

```sh
npm install -g truffle
```

## What we will build

A simple token compliant with the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

This is how most "coins" or "tokens" are implemented on Ethereum.
It defines a common interface to

* Transfer tokens
* Allow other parties to transfer tokens
* Check balance for tokens
* Emit events for token transfers and allowance approvals
  * `emit` creates event logs

## ERC-20 interface {.shrink}

```solidity
// Returns the total supply of tokens
// `view` promises NOT to modify state
// `returns` declares output parameter (default: 0)
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)

// Returns the balance of `_owner`
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)

// Transfers `_value` from sender to `_to`
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Transfers `_value` from `_from` to `_to` if `_from` authorized the send
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, 
                      uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Approves `_spender` to spend `_value` on behalf of the sender
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Returns how much `_spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of `_owner`
function allowance(address _owner, 
                   address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

// Is emitted when `_from` transfers `_value` to `_to`
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
// Is emitted when `_owner` allows `_spender` to spend `_value` on his behalf
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

## Token specifics

We will build a very simple token:

* Fixed total supply (1,000,000 for the sake of example)
  * No tokens can be created or burned after creation
* All tokens belong to owner at contract creation time
* No other particular limitation
