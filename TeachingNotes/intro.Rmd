# Definition of blockchain

### What is blockchain? (How do you understand blockchain)

---

[IBM and Oliver Wyman:](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/what-is-blockchain)

> Blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. 
An asset can be tangible --- a house, a car, cash, land --- or intangible like intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, or branding. 
Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

---

[Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

> A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

---

[Oxford:](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/blockchain)

> a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network

### What problem(s) does a blockchain solve?

---

## De/centralization

### Why was there centralization in the first place?

---

#### Centralization of payment system

- 1990s, standards for protocol-level encryption just emerged
- Lack of trust
    - Security
    - Privacy
- Birth of the intermediary architecture

#### Centralization of monetary system

- "Fiat" currency: trust in the government
    - IOU from a bank vs IOU from a stranger
    - Gold standard: 1 oz gold = 35 USD


**It made things easier --- because you only have to trust one entity.**

---

### Is a central authority still *necessary* today?

---

*Possibility* to abandon central authority

- Security mechanisms advanced
- Payment scheme was lagging behind


---

### But can we just leave it?

---

Necessity [?] to abandon central authority

#### Monetary system

- Abandonment of the gold standard
- Capital control
- Hyperinflation: Zimbabwe and Venezuela
    - Deficit government spending
    - National debt
    - Heavy money-printing
- Financial crisis

#### Payment system

- Privacy

### What problem does a blockchain cause?

... and things to consider when choosing between a blockchain and a centralized database.

---

## Distributed -> Latency

### Double spending

Double spending is a problem native to a distributed network due to latency, but less problematic in a centralized one.


### Detecting double spending

Imagine:

- You have $100 in your bank account
- You issue to merchants A and B *each* a $100 check 


What will happen?

---


### Preventing double spending in a *centralized* system

Law enforcement: You'll be punished if you double spend.


### Preventing double spending in a *decentralized* system

Consensus mechanism (to be discussed) -- which need not be considered if using a centralized system in the first place.

## Transparency -> Privacy issues

### No real ID needed -- only a BTC address

Does pseudonymity suffice for privacy protection?


---

### UTXO (Unspent transaction output)

## Origins of blockchain technology

Bitcoin is the fruit of pieces of prior technology

- b-money [@Dai1998]
    - Distributed payment protocol:
        1. broadcasting (paying)
        1. bookkeeping
        1. confirming
- Hashcash [@Back2002]
    - Proof of work
